# DIFS - DO IT FROM SCRATCH

Everything I learn from data structures & algorithms to machine learning & deep learning is coded from scratch 100% and stored here for later review. Please rate a star if you find anything useful.

## FINISHED

Check README.md in each folder for more details about:

### Traditional machine learning algorithms

- [x] Linear regression (extend) => Compare **regression** with **interpolation**
- [x] Logistic regression
- [x] Decision tree
- [x] Softmax regression
- [x] k-Nearest Neighbor
- [x] DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)
- [ ] Support vector machine

### Deep learning

- [x] Fully-connected network
- [ ] Convolutional network
- [ ] Long short-term memory
- [ ] Transformer
