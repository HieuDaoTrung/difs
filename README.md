# DIFS - DO IT FROM SCRATCH

Everything I have learned, from data structures & algorithms to machine learning & robotics, is coded solely from scratch.

The bare mininum packages used here are just numerical toolboxes such as PyTorch or Numpy. Some tasks, e.g., control theory, are done in MATLAB/Simulink.

Codes are saved here publicly for my future review. Each package contains a README.md file that describes more details about things inside:

## Traditional machine learning algorithms

- [x] Linear regression (extend) => Compare **regression** with **interpolation**
- [x] Logistic regression
- [x] Decision tree
- [x] Softmax regression
- [x] k-Nearest Neighbor
- [x] DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)
- [ ] Support vector machine

## Deep learning

- [x] Fully-connected network
- [x] Convolutional network
- [ ] Long short-term memory
- [ ] Transformer

## Signal Processing (SSP)

- [ ] Estimators
- [ ] FIR/IIR Filters
- [ ] Hypothesis testing & classical inference algorithms
- [ ] Optimizers

## Control Theory

- [x] Model-based fault detection using parity method
- [x] Fault-tolerance control with virtual sensor and virtual actuator
- [ ] Model-free fault detection using statistics
